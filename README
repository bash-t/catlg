Catlg is a catalog. Use it to manage and display collections of things.

Catlg is a CouchApp. To install it, get CouchDB up and running on your 
machine, install the couchapp command-line tool 
(http://couchapp.org/page/installing), cd into the Catlg directory, and 
run the following command:

    $ couchapp push . http://127.0.0.1:5984/catlg

If you add a .couchapprc file to the Catlg directory with the following 
in it all you have to do is `couchapp push`:

    {
      "env": {
        "default": {
          "db": "http://127.0.0.1:5984/catlg/"
        }
      }
    }
