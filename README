Catlg is a catalog. Use it to manage and display collections of things.

Catlg is a CouchApp (http://couchapp.org). To install it, get CouchDB 
up and running on your machine, cd into the Catlg directory, and run 
the following command:

    $ couchapp push . http://127.0.0.1:5984/catlg

Add a .couchapprc file to the Catlg directory with the following in it 
and all you have to do is `couchapp push`:

    {
      "env": {
        "default": {
          "db": "http://127.0.0.1:5984/catlg/"
        }
      }
    }
